The provided code appears to analyze stock data from a CSV file (presumably containing data for TCS.NS, based on the file name) using Pandas. The script calculates the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and checks for volume spikes.

Here's a brief explanation of what the code does:

It imports the required libraries: datetime for handling dates and pandas for data manipulation.

It defines constants such as START_DATE, END_DATE, EMA_PERIOD, and VOLUME_SPIKE_WINDOW.

It reads data from a CSV file named 'TCS.NS.csv' into a Pandas DataFrame.

It calculates the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of closing prices over a specified period (EMA_PERIOD).

It iterates through the DataFrame rows starting from the 253rd row (as the EMA calculation requires preceding data) and checks for conditions where the EMA is greater than the closing price and the volume exceeds 1.5 times the average volume within a specified window (VOLUME_SPIKE_WINDOW).

The script prints the date and closing price when a volume spike (50% higher than the average volume) occurs alongside the condition where the EMA is greater than the closing price.

This code could be useful for identifying potential trading opportunities based on volume spikes and EMA crossovers. However, it's essential to perform further analysis and risk management before executing trades based solely on these signals. Additionally, backtesting such strategies can provide insights into their historical performance and help assess their viability.

With Custom Dates
print in table Stocks, invested_Amount, current_value_of_today, Cumulative_Percentage,

Total_invested_Amount, Total_Cumulative_percentage

 Maintain one master .csv Sheet, that shoud have row with all stock name, and column with Month with Years

Whenever there is a buy just put a entry as "BUY" on respective cell, so the logic behind is to avoid the duplicate entry on same month, if already bought then we are nto going to buy the same stock on same month, we will wait for next mont and see for the confition match
